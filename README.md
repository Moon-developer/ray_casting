# Ray Casting Experiment

This repo holds a small app to experiment ray casting in Python. Because Python isn't the most practical language for
such a task this is more to focus on the algorithm required to execute suck a task.

## SETUP

To run this experiment run the following commands:
```bash
$ git clone <this_repo>
$ cd <cloned_repo>
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python main.py
```
